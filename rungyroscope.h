 * Yaw: rotate the robot around the z axis (pivot rotation), in one direction and the opposite one; the more the rate
 * of rotation the more leds will turn on.
 * Pitch: rotate the robot around the y axis (motor axis), in one direction and the opposite one; the more the rate
 * of rotation the more leds will turn on.
