This is the e-puck firmware used at the chair for data processing. It is based on
GCtronic's default firmware (http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/E-Puck), but
focuses on the Overo interface and robot formation control.

Instead of using the MPLAB IDE poject like GCtronicm, our version uses CMake for
building and eclipse as IDE.

The project assumes that you put it into a subdirectory of the "program"-folder
of e-pucks SVN-tree. You can find these files on http://gna.org/projects/e-puck/

To build the firmware, check toolchain-xc16-pic.cmake for the right path to the
XC16 toolchain on your system and invoke cmake in the build subdirectory like
this:
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain-xc16-pic.cmake ..
